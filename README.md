Note: To quit you must either click the `/~ key and type quit, or close the window manually (task manager, ALT+F4, etcâ€¦).

Controls:
A / Left Arrow - Move Left
D / Right Arrow - Move Right
W / Up Arrow / Space - Jump
S / Down Arrow - Crouch
Z - Punch
X - Kick
C - Special

How to Play:
Near the end of doing an action (punch or kick) click another action, this will activate the next ability in that string.
- Example: Press Z -> Z -> X -> Z, with the last three being at the end of the previous animation, to execute that combo.
Special can only be used after another action, and will end the combo string.
Pressing Punch [Z] and Kick [X] at the same time will execute a Hurricane Kick.
Punching [Z] or Kicking [X] works in air, and Kicking [X] works while crouched to do a sweep.
You can cancel the first punch with a jump.

The middle of the screen is a placeholder "dummy", which the character will always face towards. This dummy does not react to player actions. You can jump over this to cross it.
